# 👋 Hi there, I'm Tobias

With a background in mechanical engineering and several years of experience in the automotive industry, I decided to shift my focus to software development. Since October 2024, I've been a full-time student at [42 Heilbronn](https://42heilbronn.de).

I’m passionate about problem-solving, systems thinking, and building things that actually work. I bring with me real-world industry experience and a strong motivation to grow into roles in software development, IT administration, or DevOps.

🔧 Skills and experience in:
- Mechanical engineering / automotive production
- Software development (C, C++, Python, Shell, Git)
- Linux systems and system architecture

🚀 Currently looking for a **software engineering or IT internship**.

📍 Based near Stuttgart, Germany

It’s exposed securely through a Cloudflare tunnel and includes QR-based login with JWT authentication. I built this tool to dive deeper into backend/frontend communication, token handling, CORS workarounds, and secure tunneling. The app reads system info like CPU/memory usage and offers a one-tap shutdown feature—all from a mobile UI. |
