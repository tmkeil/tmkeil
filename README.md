Mechanical engineer turned software developer. After a B.Eng. and six years at Mercedes-Benz, I joined 42 Heilbronn to build software from the ground up — starting with C, working through systems programming, and now building production web applications. I bring the structured problem-solving from engineering into writing reliable, maintainable code.

**Looking for:** Cloud & DevOps, Software Development positions (available from April 2026)  
*Currently learning: Kubernetes, cloud-native deployment*
